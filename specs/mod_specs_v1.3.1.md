v1.3.1 - 2019-11-09

---

The difference between v1.3.0 and v1.3.1 is only whether SSG noise pitch is reversed.  
This change affects the unit data of SSG tone/noise sequence and the effect value of steps in patterns where SSG noise pitch is set.

Other data fields are remained from [v1.3.0](./mod_specs_v1.3.0.md).
