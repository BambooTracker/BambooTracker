Blip_buf Change Log
-------------------

blip_buf 1.1.0 (2009-10-06)
--------------
* Changed library name to blip_buf, to make it easier to find uses of on
the Web.

* Increased internal input-output ratio accuracy greatly when compiler
supports 64-bit integer type.

* Renamed blip_buffer_t to blip_t, for consistency with function names.
Old name is deprecated.

* Reduced high-pass so that a bit more bass comes through.

* Made header file minimally Doxygen-compatible.

* Added unit test suite.

* Added assertions to catch more precondition violations (negative
values, etc.)

* blip_new() sets default rate to blip_max_ratio clocks per sample.

* blip_delete() can now accept NULL, as originally claimed.

* blip_clocks_needed() now properly returns zero when passed zero.

* blip_add_delta_fast() now adds delta at same place blip_add_delta()'s
center of delta would be, rather than one sample later as before.

* blip_add_delta() and blip_add_delta_fast() allow adding slightly past
buffer size, as originally claimed.


blip 1.0.0 (2008-12-08)
----------
* First release
